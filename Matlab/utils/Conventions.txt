Some conventions concerning various mathematical structures:

All vectors are assumed to be column vectors. Row vectors must be explicitly labeled as such, or the transpose notation must be used. I.e. the row vector x is equal to the vector x transposed (x' in Matlab notation.)

The gradient of a scalar function of a vector is a row vector, i.e. df/dx = [df/dx1, df/dx2, ..., df/dxn]

By natural extension, the Jacobian matrix of a vector-valued function will have as many columns as there are values in the input x and as many rows as there are values in the output f(x).
i.e. Jf(x) = [ df1/dx1, ..., df1/dxn
               df2/dx1, ..., df2/dxn ]
                
The Hessian of a scalar function is a square, symmetric matrix where the ith row is the gradient of the ith element of the gradient. By natural extension, the Hessian of a vector-valued function is a 3-dimensional tensor where each "page" of the tensor is the standard Hessian matrix of the corresponding scalar function from the original vector function. However, in Matlab we will represent Hessians by using an array of cells, where each cell will correspond to a 2-D matrix.
